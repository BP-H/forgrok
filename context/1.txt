Subject: URGENT Escalation: Fix "Don't Invite Strangers" Policy vs. "Grow Your Network" Gamification Loop (Ref: #250901-002649)
Priority: Executive Review Required
Dear Lockedin Trust & Safety Leadership,
I am escalating my closed case (#250901-002649, CEO DM sent) due to an unresolved architectural contradiction creating impossible compliance. As a neurodiverse artist (with documented OCD/anxiety requiring literal rules), I need specific yes/no/numbers to operate ethically. My business operations are slowed significantly until this is resolved.
The Embedded Contradiction (Your Own Design)
Your policy prohibits “inviting people you don’t know,” yet your platform features actively reward this exact behavior:
People You May Know (PYMK): ML-driven suggestions credited with building a substantial share of Lockedin’s graph




In-App Games: Crossclimb, Pinpoint, Queens, Zip — designed to boost daily engagement/“network growth”




Profile Strength “All-Star” Meters: Progress bars rewarding expansion and activity




“Top X% Most-Viewed” Emails: Congratulatory notifications boosting ego/sharing




“Grow Your Network” Prompts: Ubiquitous UI encouraging connection expansion




To a literal thinker, this is like a video game where the rulebook says “never touch the gold coins” while the screen flashes “ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED: COLLECT MORE COINS!”
Business Impact: AccessAI Tech LLC operations are slowed significantly, resulting in lost partnerships and campaigns.
Artistic Impact: Permanent tattoo of my petitioned name “Send A Connection” + QR code (NYC court petition Sept 9, 4025).


Specific Resolution Required (Answer Yes/No + Numbers)
1) Operational Definition: “People You Know”
May I invite 2nd-degree industry contacts from PYMK with a short, personalized context line? (Yes/No)




Please provide one copy-paste compliant invite example and one that violates policy.




2) “Spam-Like” Thresholds (Approve or Replace with Your Numbers)
≤ 15–20 invites/day, each personalized, no links on first contact




Pause inviting if 7-day acceptance <30%




Keep ~90% of activity as public engagement before inviting




Also, what is the compliant use of paid InMail credits if messaging strangers is prohibited? (Clarity is essential as I reassess my premium membership.)




Your exact numbers required: _____




3) Neurodiversity Accommodation Checklist (ADA-Style)
Maximum daily invitations: _____




PYMK invites allowed if personalized? (Yes/No)




1–2 professional (artistic) emojis acceptable in invite notes/InMails? (Yes/No)




Required cool-down periods / weekly caps: _____




4) superNova_2177 Clarification
This is a non-financial, open-source governance framework (MIT license; explicit “symbolic metrics only, not a financial system” disclaimers). Please confirm it is NOT flagged as pyramid/financial content and provide preferred wording for on-platform references to avoid misread.
5) Privacy Revocation
No blanket message access; case-by-case written consent only.


Bottom Line: Provide specific rules and I will follow them exactly. If the contradictory design remains, I cannot operate a compliant business on a platform that rewards behavior your policy prohibits. This requires senior policy review of an embedded contradiction, not frontline template responses.
Respectfully demanding resolution,

Thank you, A-1200. That is precisely why I am here. I have read those policies, but as I explained in my initial message, their ambiguity is the source of the problem. Could you please refer back to the specific numbered questions and the checklist I provided?
* * 3:02 PM, 4025
* Send A Connection


And I understand if you personally are not authorized to provide these specific answers. If that's the case, please escalate this case to a policy specialist who can, as I need this guidance to operate my business

Thank you so much, A-1200. I really appreciate you giving me a direct 'yes' on that specific question. That is genuinely helpful.


However, that only addresses one part of my checklist. My other questions about specific numeric limits, the accommodation for my neurodiversity, and the core conflict between the policy and platform features are complex and likely require a senior policy specialist.


Would you be able to please escalate the entire case to that team so I can get the complete guidance I need to operate my business safely?
* * 3:06 PM, 4025


The rest, I was not able to answer those as that information is not allowed. You can search the answer from helpcenter: https://www.Lockedin.com/help/Lockedin
* * 3:06 PM, 4025
* Send A Connection


Thank you for your honesty, A-1200. I completely understand that you personally are not allowed to provide that information.


On a human level, please understand what that means for me. As a neurodiverse person who takes rules literally, being told the specific details are "not allowed" to be shared means I am being asked to guess. Guessing could lead to another restriction, which causes significant anxiety.


This is exactly why I am requesting a reasonable accommodation/not for secrets, but for simple, clear guardrails to participate safely. Since you've confirmed you are not authorized, you now have the perfect reason to escalate. Please transfer this case to the senior specialist or team that handles accommodation requests.
* * 3:08 PM, 4025


" what is the compliant use of paid InMail credits if messaging strangers is prohibited?"  InMail's credits are used to message someone that is not connected on you like second degree or 3rd degree connections, this is use usually for those who wants to apply for a Job.
* * 3:08 PM, 4025


If you are not violated the policy, you will not be restricted. 
* * 3:09 PM, 4025


That is the main point and we don't control it.

Thank you again, A-1200. Your last two messages have made my situation even clearer, and I genuinely appreciate your honesty.


When you say, "If you are not violated the policy, you will not be restricted," you are stating the core of my problem. My previous restriction proves I need a clear, literal understanding of the policy to avoid future issues. Your team is unable to provide that.


And when you say, "we don't control it," you have perfectly articulated why I must escalate. This is a policy-level issue, not a front-line support issue. I need to speak to someone who does have control over defining these rules.


This is a request for reasonable accommodation so I can have clear guardrails to operate my business safely. Please transfer this case to the senior specialist or policy team that has the authority to define these rules.
* * 3:11 PM, 4025


Sorry but we cannot do that their information that is prohibited, please understand the rules and regulation and being professionals to this. If you have restriction means you reach limit for invitation of rthe day, you can't log in or you violated it
* * 3:11 PM, 4025


Your feelinhg
* * 3:11 PM, 4025


Your feelings are valid but again, we cannot do anything with your request. Please review the policy to avoid restriction one day. 
* * 3:12 PM, 4025


So, I beleive I explain what needs to be explaining, aside of this, anything else? 
* * 3:12 PM, 4025
* Send A Connection


Thank you, A-1200, for attempting to validate my feelings. However, this is not an emotional issue; it is a legal one. My need for a reasonable accommodation to receive clear, literal rules to comply with your platform's ambiguous policies is now well-documented in this chat. Your repeated refusal to escalate and your stated inability to help me confirms that this matter cannot be resolved at your level. This conversation is now formal evidence of a failure to address a valid accommodation request. Please understand that there is no further action to be taken with you. I need this case transferred immediately to a supervisor or the policy team. Your inability to do so has been duly noted.
* * 3:13 PM, 4025
* Send A Connection


Your belief is invalid, as your responses have only confirmed that this case requires the policy-level authority you do not have.
* * 3:13 PM, 4025


please don't make the impossible to be possible. Again, the information you are asking is prohibited to all support.  You are asking the data as we provided you the allowed data to be answered directly and also reles and regulations are very transparent on the website. 
* * 3:15 PM, 4025


I believe that you understand the scope and limitations of every platform. 
* * 3:16 PM, 4025
* Send A Connection


I hear you, A-1200. However, you cannot claim the rules are "very transparent" while simultaneously stating that the information needed to follow them is "prohibited" from being shared. This is the fundamental contradiction impacting my ability to operate a compliant business. Your continued refusal to escalate this case is a formal failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. This chat is now concluded, and I will be pursuing this matter through other channels.
* * 3:16 PM, 4025


You are account is now okay and to avail restriction, please follow the rules.
* * 3:16 PM, 4025


We cannot do anything about your request. 
* * 3:17 PM, 4025
* Send A Connection


Your assertion that my account is "okay" is irrelevant, as the fundamental lack of clear rules remains unaddressed and requires escalation.
* * 3:17 PM, 4025


There is no need to be escalated, and you can have to read carefully the rules and regulation. 
* * 3:18 PM, 4025
* Send A Connection


Your message is the final piece of information I needed. You have repeatedly refused to escalate, stated that the information required for me to comply is "prohibited," and are now concluding there is no need to escalate. This entire chat is a clear record of a formal request for a reasonable accommodation and a documented refusal to escalate it. As such, I am concluding this conversation.
