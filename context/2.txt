A Final, Collaborative Path Forward (Case #250915-027670)
Dear SR-9000,


I had a eureka moment today that compelled me to reach out. Since I cannot currently run my business as I wish and also don't have the stability of a 9 to 5 job like I had for the last 10‚Äì15 years, this artistic project has become even more meaningful to me. Thank you for your professional engagement - this has been a meaningful and unexpected development in an art project I had already begun.

To provide a clear and final framework that avoids a prolonged back-and-forth, I am consolidating our entire discussion into this single proposal.


For complete context, my work is governed by the superNova2177 protocol, the source file for which is attached. I suspect my account's past restrictions stemmed from a misunderstanding of this project. To be unequivocally clear, this is strictly an artistic and scientific framework, not a financial system. Its Tri-Species Harmony governance model is designed from the ground up to define how individuals, AIs, and companies like yours can interact democratically in this new ecosystem. In a future setting, the system could even support concepts like universal basic income (UBI) in a non-monetary way - envisioned more like a living metaverse game where symbolic ‚Äúmoney‚Äù functions as in‚Äëgame items or resources.


Given the documented failure of standard support channels, which has directly impacted the OCD/anxiety I manage under professional care, three accommodations are now required as a non‚Äënegotiable baseline for any resolution.

Required Accommodations for Resolution

1) Communication Channel. The only channel that has proven effective is a direct escalation to the CEO's office. Therefore, under the principles of the ADA for a reasonable accommodation, I require any future communication to be cc'd/bcc'd to the CEO.

2) The Operational Rulebook. After my account was restricted, I spent months without a clear answer explaining what I did wrong. That silence forced me to question everything about my professional conduct: my scientific work, my artistic expression, even my use of emojis. To this day, I still do not know what specific rule I broke. To prevent this debilitating uncertainty from ever happening again, I require specific, numerical and yes/no answers to the policy questions I previously submitted.

3) Full Review of superNova2177.py. To address the vague suspensions that caused this crisis of professional confidence, I require a comprehensive review of the attached superNova_2177.py (full repo later) by your Trust & Safety team. This must confirm its compliance and result in explicit clearance to make the repo public again. Note: there may be a few minor bugs, as I was still refining it until your recent suspension put me in alert mode and halted further work. Your developer should be able to get the hang of it quickly.

Once these baseline requirements are addressed, we can turn to the artistic aspect of this journey. The canvas I started will be finished, and your decision will define the final chapter. Each path is genuinely exciting to me, and my intent here is purely collaborative. I believe this collaboration could inspire meaningful change, and - as expected -¬†no non‚Äëdisclosure agreement (NDA) would be appropriate for this work. I invite you to select one of the following paths:

Path 1 (My Strongly Favored Path): The Goodwill Event PathA major cultural event to launch the superNova_2177 non‚Äëprofit, sponsored by LockedIn in NYC, featuring an appearance by üëëKarinaüëë of aespa to a playlist reflecting the project's themes. My anonymity would be preserved.

Path 2: The Public Advocacy Path - A long‚Äëterm collaboration where LockedIn formally grants me the role of Top Voice for Neurodiversity Advocacy. Alternatively, a similar ¬†partnership by the use of a designated pink logo (RGB/hex specified by me) on relevant advocacy content we co‚Äëcreate. I would operate under my anonymous avatar, with any honorariums directed to the non‚Äëprofit. (Respectfully, as an artist‚Äôs opinion: design and color taste is always subjective, still¬†I really dislike the gold logo for premium; not great color choice in my artistic view)

Path 3: The Reparations Path - This path addresses direct impacts, including a formal apology, reimbursement of approximately $100 in costs, and 18 months of transitional health insurance(at a level equivalent to my wife's comprehensive policy that I am losing indirectly but substantially due to LockedIn's actions), with all funds managed through the non‚Äëprofit.

Path 4: The Board Partnership Path - A designated LockedIn executive is appointed to the Board of Directors of my non‚Äëprofit for a two‚Äëyear term, creating a deep, non‚Äëfinancial structural partnership.

Path 5: The ‚ÄúBlind Trust‚Äù Artistic Commission - LockedIn agrees to acquire and display a series of ten of my art pieces in your new New York office, sight unseen. The significant artist‚Äôs fee would be donated in full to the non‚Äëprofit.

Path 6: The Direct Connection Path -¬†The CEO establishes a functional, last‚Äëresort channel for accommodation purposes - either by sending me a connection request on LockedIn or, with prior consent, sharing a direct email for accommodation‚Äërelated communication.

Path 7: The Original Artistic Path - The project proceeds on its documented course: ‚ÄúThe World Art Tour,‚Äù followed by¬†‚Äú50 U.S. States / 50 Names / 50 Tattoos,‚Äù with our interactions forming the substance of the art.

An Unnumbered Path: A Creative Invitation

Should none of the paths above fully align with your vision, I warmly invite you to propose your own creative continuation of this project.

To offer optional, internal inspiration specific to this unnumbered path, I suggest exploring the top 10‚Äì15 most well‚Äëknown aespa songs (lyrics and official videos). Their narratives and visuals have been a significant internal influence on superNova2177. The work often overlaps metaphorically with digital identity, systemic challenges, and collaborative harmony - useful prompts for any collaborative approach you envision.

Please consider this solely an internal creative prompt, at your discretion.

Governance & Process

Any such proposal would be subject to a formal, democratic vote by the international board of my non-profit (a process initiated but not yet completed due to this communication and art project), governed by the superNova2177 protocol. You will have one opportunity to submit a proposal meaningful enough to pass this transparent process. Outcome‚Äëspecific implementation will be conditional on the selected path and project scope.

Regarding superNova2177.py, as noted above, there may be minor issues from the halted iteration. Your developer‚Äôs careful review and questions are welcome.

This response may seem slightly early, but artistically, the piece is complete; prolonging it could diminish quality. After purchasing my travel tickets, I will wait for my name change to be processed, renew my passport, and in the meantime begin the art project and peaceful protest I mentioned in New York City. Once the name change process is complete, the larger world tour will start and continue across all 50 states, at a natural pace. I will be purchasing my travel tickets next week to continue the next phase of this work. I sincerely hope that by then, you will have chosen one of the collaborative paths.

It is your call. At this point, I am motivated only by my art.

Warm regards and virtual hugs ü§ó
