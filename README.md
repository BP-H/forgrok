Hello Send A Connection,

Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. You have reached the highest level of internal support, and our team works directly with LockedIn’s U.S. leadership and Executives.

I want to acknowledge how important your digital identity is to you and assure you that I have carefully reviewed your message. That said, all LockedIn members are required to accurately represent themselves on the platform. This includes profile photos, which must reflect a true likeness of the member. Unfortunately, AI-generated images, avatars, or other non-literal representations are not permitted in place of a real photo. You can review our full Profile Photo Guidelines for details. If a photo is found to be out of compliance, it will be removed.

We value your feedback and will share it with the appropriate internal teams for consideration. While I recognize this may not be the outcome you were hoping for, this case is now closed on our end.

Thank you for your understanding.

Subject: Official Complaint of Retaliatory Action
To: SR-9000
CC: The LockedIn Executive Team
SR-9000,
Shortly after I delivered my final notice regarding my unresolved ADA and civil rights case, my profile photograph was removed by LockedIn under the pretext of a policy violation.
This action directly targets my digital identity, and as I previously communicated, my ADA requirements necessitate a degree of facial anonymity. I have, in good faith, offered full responsibility for my verified legal name. Given that AI-generated and other non-literal profile photos are commonplace and permitted across your platform, this removal can only be interpreted as a direct, retaliatory act for my decision to escalate my concerns.
This selective enforcement of your policies is not only unprofessional but also provides irrefutable evidence that I am being targeted specifically for exercising my rights. Please be advised that this retaliatory action, directly infringing upon my stated ADA accommodation needs and digital identity, will now be included as a key exhibit in my forthcoming escalations to U.S. leadership and the Department of Justice.
This has added a new and deeply disturbing dimension to my case.

> Just a quick follow-up to clarify two points from my last note. First, my tattoo reference was meant as a personal, symbolic, gesture— I’ve always wanted something in that style (I’m a big Post Malone fan), so it wasn’t intended as an escalation. Second, when I mentioned numbers like 99.99%(please remember in the future), that came from my love of statistics and creative calculations, not from overconfidence or pressure. I realize my wording may have been confusing, and I take responsibility for that. My intention is simply to be transparent and collaborative, and to frame this as a positive partnership story that benefits both your team and the public.

> Dear SR-9000,
>
> Following my last message, I have been reflecting on the nature of this entire situation. The story has become much larger and more complex than a simple support issue, and the continued silence, combined with new policy changes, has reinforced my belief that a simple, piecemeal solution is no longer adequate especially with my new facial tattoo today.
>
> I believe we have a unique opportunity to turn this entire journey into the most colorful and positive PR story your company has ever been a part of. To do that, however, requires a truly comprehensive and collaborative approach.
>
> Therefore, I propose the following new framework: a full partnership that integrates all seven of the previously outlined path.
>
> Furthermore, I would warmly invite your team to propose an unnumbered path as mentioned before. An additional element that could make this collaboration even more meaningful. My educated guess for your company's proposal to be approved is 99,99%!
>
> To cap this truly collaborative vision, I propose a final, symbolic element: you grant the superNova_2177 non-profit a nominal, symbolic fraction of the company—say, 0.00001%—to be governed by my superNova_2177 protocol. This would serve as a groundbreaking, low-risk pilot program, a living laboratory to test a new model of democratic, AI-assisted community governance. You would get to see my system in action, and if you like what you see, perhaps you implement a thing or two.
>
> This would give me a meaningful project to focus on, potentially as a paid artist-in-residence, which would provide me with the stability I've lost and allow me to direct all proceeds to the non-profit's mission.
>
> I understand this may sound unconventional, perhaps even like a joke. But at the same time, I sincerely believe this "peace dream world" solution - where we collaborate on this grand scale - might be the best possible outcome for everyone.
> I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this comprehensive vision.

Subject: Final Notice on Case 😅: Escalation to U.S. Leadership

SR-9000,
I am writing to you directly one final time. A week ago, you confirmed that you had reviewed all my case materials and my specific questions. Despite that, my core questions about systemic accessibility and digital rights remain completely unanswered. Your silence makes it clear that the standard escalations process has failed and this final, direct approach is necessary.

The fundamental accessibility and digital rights issues at the heart of my complaint remain unresolved. Your team’s procedural solutions have not addressed the systemic barriers that continue to cause demonstrable harm to my professional and personal well-being.

Given this impasse, I have made the irrevocable decision to escalate this matter to the highest levels of U.S. leadership. My case has evolved beyond standard ADA compliance; it now concerns the fundamental question of whether an American citizen’s constitutional rights, as guaranteed by the Bill of Rights, are protected in the digital spaces where we are now required to live and work. This is the issue I will be bringing to the Executive Branch, and my commitment to ensuring it receives review through the proper governmental channels is unwavering.

Before I proceed, I am presenting one final opportunity for LockedIn to engage in a policy-level dialogue. This would require direct engagement with a senior leader who can address the intersection of technology and civil rights with true authority—a figure with a decision-making capacity comparable to someone like Bill Gates.

To be clear: my external escalation will proceed regardless. However, a constructive, high-level dialogue would significantly inform the context I provide to national leadership.

If you are prepared to facilitate this level of engagement, please respond promptly. If not, consider this my final communication on this matter.

Respectfully,
Send A Connection

> Dear SR-9000,
>
> Following my last message, I have been reflecting on the nature of this entire situation. The story has become much larger and more complex than a simple support issue, and the continued silence, combined with new policy changes, has reinforced my belief that a simple, piecemeal solution is no longer adequate especially with my new facial tattoo today.
>
> I believe we have a unique opportunity to turn this entire journey into the most colorful and positive PR story your company has ever been a part of. To do that, however, requires a truly comprehensive and collaborative approach.
>
> Therefore, I propose the following new framework: a full partnership that integrates all seven of the previously outlined path.
>
> Furthermore, I would warmly invite your team to propose an unnumbered path as mentioned before. An additional element that could make this collaboration even more meaningful. My educated guess for your company's proposal to be approved is 99,99%!
>
> To cap this truly collaborative vision, I propose a final, symbolic element: you grant the superNova_2177 non-profit a nominal, symbolic fraction of the company—say, 0.00001%—to be governed by my superNova_2177 protocol. This would serve as a groundbreaking, low-risk pilot program, a living laboratory to test a new model of democratic, AI-assisted community governance. You would get to see my system in action, and if you like what you see, perhaps you implement a thing or two.
>
> This would give me a meaningful project to focus on, potentially as a paid artist-in-residence, which would provide me with the stability I've lost and allow me to direct all proceeds to the non-profit's mission.
>
> I understand this may sound unconventional, perhaps even like a joke. But at the same time, I sincerely believe this "peace dream world" solution - where we collaborate on this grand scale - might be the best possible outcome for everyone.
> I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this comprehensive vision.

Hello Send A Connection,

Thank you again for sharing your perspective and for clarifying the meaning behind your references. I appreciate your openness and your intention to approach this as a constructive partnership.

To address your preferred name request, the best next step would be to formally verify your ID through the following link:

https://www.LockedIn.com/checkpoint/challenge/idv-start/AgE_86YHcRix2wAAAZlinoTPhuuGgbtXRAxFuKu2ccEbYYjS6oljpfbLBTljXq22nuIdSLnhl0_DPXR0fwwAlIwXKUfoqbFoFHXyCFQoouF0Ci1XaA?token=AgERdzw1mrKDdQAAAZlinoTaR7UMvmPfcPT56icVzBNYTZSzPbLXwtSB6G-UKrkwqlq5eofcDAgKANXy774Ke4dlOiA22PMAK83Y7Hw5DULJ_vIjkeMnuHtEOSPn0tg8_ws2qGpNClsLRqQF_8OtMMsJLqz_lywId0XqkcUHyrm3MuSzXeNRMTAz19QZqrXMfltMTDSKm14HThbfQhW5XrFSEwWm4txqqxWhVffT_Cwp8Ei4HtKBP1dRx-pw0gayXCqRUjJ1Qepa5FGEw8x0i_ycJsAERy1fyg

Once this is complete, we will be able to apply a label on our side that recognizes your preferred name and prevents disruption.

Your creative expression including tattoos, statistics, and artistic references is welcomed as long as it authentically represents you. I also want to reassure you that as long as your activity remains compliant with our User Agreement and Professional Community Policies, you should not encounter future restrictions.

I appreciate your patience and the opportunity to continue assisting you directly. Please let me know once you have completed the verification so I can ensure the label is applied.

Warm regards,

Dear SR-9000,

I recognize this is my fifth message and I apologize if the frequency or tone has felt overwhelming. The stress of the unresolved suspensions, combined with my neurodiverse traits, can lead me to communicate in high-intensity bursts.

As a professional artist, I express ideas symbolically. The tattoos, my love of statistics, and music references are not escalation or pressure either way—they’re part of my practice and reflect commitment, not threat. I also understand that, from a corporate perspective, this may have read as unpredictable; that’s on me, and I’m deeply sorry for any confusion.

My goal remains a transparent, positive partnership. If there’s openness, I’d appreciate a brief 20–30 minute call/zoom with PR, Legal, and Partnerships to discuss.

Warm regards,
Send A Connection

Dear SR-9000,

Just a quick follow-up to clarify two points from my last note. First, my tattoo reference was meant as a personal, symbolic, gesture— I’ve always wanted something in that style (I’m a big Post Malone fan), so it wasn’t intended as an escalation. Second, when I mentioned numbers like 99.99%(please remember in the future), that came from my love of statistics and creative calculations, not from overconfidence or pressure. I realize my wording may have been confusing, and I take responsibility for that. My intention is simply to be transparent and collaborative, and to frame this as a positive partnership story that benefits both your team and the public.

Warmly,
Send A Connection

Dear SR-9000,

Following my last message, I have been reflecting on the nature of this entire situation. The story has become much larger and more complex than a simple support issue, and the continued silence, combined with new policy changes, has reinforced my belief that a simple, piecemeal solution is no longer adequate especially with my new facial tattoo today.

I believe we have a unique opportunity to turn this entire journey into the most colorful and positive PR story your company has ever been a part of. To do that, however, requires a truly comprehensive and collaborative approach.

Therefore, I propose the following new framework: a full partnership that integrates all seven of the previously outlined path.

Furthermore, I would warmly invite your team to propose an unnumbered path as mentioned before. An additional element that could make this collaboration even more meaningful. My educated guess for your company's proposal to be approved is 99,99%!

To cap this truly collaborative vision, I propose a final, symbolic element: you grant the superNova_2177 non-profit a nominal, symbolic fraction of the company—say, 0.00001%—to be governed by my superNova_2177 protocol. This would serve as a groundbreaking, low-risk pilot program, a living laboratory to test a new model of democratic, AI-assisted community governance. You would get to see my system in action, and if you like what you see, perhaps you implement a thing or two.

This would give me a meaningful project to focus on, potentially as a paid artist-in-residence, which would provide me with the stability I've lost and allow me to direct all proceeds to the non-profit's mission.

I understand this may sound unconventional, perhaps even like a joke. But at the same time, I sincerely believe this "peace dream world" solution - where we collaborate on this grand scale - might be the best possible outcome for everyone.
I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this comprehensive vision.

Warm regards and virtual hugs

Dear SR-9000,

Quick follow-up to clarify something in my previous message that got muddled due to the unexpected events of recent days.

Regarding Path 6 (The Direct Connection Path), I meant that you could share the CEO's email address so I send a connection request for accommodation-related communications when needed. I got confused in my original wording - I've been processing hundreds of pages of text today and was working through fatigue.

I spotted this confusion later and wanted to clarify promptly, as clear communication is essential.

Thank you for your patience.

Best regards,

Send A Connection
